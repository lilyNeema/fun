Star Shape Drawing with Python Turtle
This project demonstrates how to draw a simple star shape using Python's turtle module. The turtle module is a popular way to introduce beginners to basic graphics programming in Python.
Expected Output
A new window will open with a black background, and a yellow star shape will be drawn by a turtle on the screen.

Code Explanation
turtle.Screen(): Sets up a window for the turtle to draw in.
turtle.Turtle(): Creates a turtle object that will draw on the screen.
draw_star(size): This function draws a star by moving the turtle forward and turning it at a 144-degree angle.
turtle.done(): Keeps the window open until you close it manually.
Customization
Star Size: You can customize the size of the star by changing the parameter in the draw_star(size) function call.
Colors: You can change the background color, turtle color, or even the turtle's shape.
